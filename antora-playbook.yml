  # Special Instructions
  # In order to document the subtle configuration differences between
  # the main branch and the staging branch, this file should contain BOTH configurations.

  # In each section (e.g. Section 1), there should be one or more lines of code for the
  # main (Prod) branch, followed by corresponding lines of code for the staging branch.keys:

  # If this is the main (prod) branch, then comment out the staging branch config.
  # If this is the staging branch, then comment out the main branch config.

  # (1A) Purpose: Where will the site be published? For prod or preview?
  # url: https://docs.tigergraph.com/ # For prod
  url: https://docs-tigergraph.netlify.app/ # For Preview
  start_page: home::index.adoc

  # (1B) Purpose: Where is the sitemap, same as the site's URL (in 1A)?
  #robots: | # For Prod (keep robots lines together as a block)
  #  User-agent: *
  #  Allow: /
  #  Sitemap: https://docs.tigergraph.com/sitemap.xml
  # Allow: /savanna/*
  robots: | # For Preview (keep robots lines together as a block)
    User-agent: *
    Allow: /
