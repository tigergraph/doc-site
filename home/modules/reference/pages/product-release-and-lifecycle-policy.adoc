:page-aliases: tigergraph-server:intro:release-process.adoc

Updated February 16, 2026

TigerGraph is committed to delivering a reliable, secure, and high-performance enterprise-grade graph database.
Our product testing and versioning are designed to ensure stable, reliable software for production.

== Version Progression and Upgrade Paths

Within a product generation, TigerGraph follows a single, forward-moving version progression.
For example, moving from 4.1 to 4.2 to 4.3, each new feature version builds upon the previous one and includes cumulative capabilities and improvements.

Customers may upgrade from an early to a later version using documented TigerGraph upgrade procedures.

== Release Lifecycle Options

TigerGraph designates some versions as LTS (Long Term Support) versions.
Other feature versions follow the standard (non-LTS) lifecycle.

=== LTS (Long Term Support) Versions

LTS versions provide an extended maintenance lifecycle. Customers who prefer less frequent upgrades may adopt LTS versions.

=== Non-LTS Versions

Non-LTS versions provide earlier access to new capabilities and are intended for teams that can accommodate a more frequent upgrade cadence.

[width="100%",cols="<1,1,1",options="header",]
|===
| Release Type | LTS | Non-LTS


| Maintenance period (bug fixes & security updates)
| 2 years
| 1 year

| Support-only period following Maintenance period
| 1 additional year
| 1 additional year

| Release cadence
| Approximately once a year
| Usually one release between LTS releases, typically about half a year after the most recent LTS release

|===

During the support-only period, TigerGraph provides technical assistance and troubleshooting but does not issue new maintenance releases.

== Lifecycle Stages

A feature version goes through the following lifecycle stages, with 3 types of releases:

. Preview Releases
. GA Release
. Maintenance Releases

== Release Numbering and Terminology

TigerGraph version numbers generally follows https://semver.org/[semantic versioning]:

 `<generation>.<feature>.<maintenance>`

Certain releases add an additional suffix to indicate the release type.

[#generation]
*Generation*

A _generation_ represents a core architecture.
The generation remains stable for years.
Upgrading to a new generation may require some migration effort.

*Feature Version*

A _feature version_ represents a set of product features.
When a new feature version is released, `<feature>` is incremented.
We strive for backward compatibility so that existing applications built on the previous feature version will continue to work without modification.

*Preview Release of a Feature Version*

A _Preview Release_ is a pre-GA release available for customer evaluation.
It is generally feature-complete.
Preview releases are not recommended for production deployment.

* A Preview release of a new feature version has `<maintenance>` = 0 and a suffix `-preN` to emphasize that this is a Preview, e.g. `4.3.0-pre1`.

*GA (General Availability) Release*

The _GA Release_ is the first production-ready release for a feature version.
The feature set is frozen.
It marks the beginning of the maintenance period for that feature version.

* The GA release of a new feature version has `<maintenance>` = 1, e.g. `4.3.1`.


*Maintenance Release/Update*

A _Maintenance Release_ addresses bugs and security issues.
It does not introduce new functionality except when necessary to resolve critical problems.

Each feature version receives its own set of maintenance releases following its GA release.
The release tempo varies, depending on the number and severity of issues that have been detected and addressed.

* The Maintenance Releases of a feature version have `<maintenance>` = 2, 3, ... as needed.

The following table summarizes the release types and their naming.

| Maintenance
| Bug fixes, security updates
| X.Y.2, +

== Release Deliverables

=== Feature Version

*Documentation:*
When a new feature version is introduced as a Preview relesase, the following documentation deliverables accompany the software release:

* A new branch in the TigerGraph online documentation for that product version (found at https://docs.tigergraph.com/https://docs.tigergraph.com/[docs.tigergraph.com])
* xref:tigergraph-server:release-notes:index.adoc[] section included in the TigerGraph online documentation.
* xref:tigergraph-server:installation:upgrade.adoc[Upgrade] section included in the TigerGraph online documentation.

*Notification:* Feature releases will be announced on our documentation website.
TigerGraph’s Customer Success team will also proactively share the release notes with existing customers.

*Upgrade Support:* Customers using an older version should refer to the upgrade section of the online documentation and should https://tigergraph.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/[open a support ticket] for assistance.

=== Maintenance Release

A Maintenance release provides fixes and improvements for a particular feature version.
The release cycle varies, depending on the number and severity of issues that have been detected and addressed.

*Documentation:*
We do not provide a new documentation branch for maintenance releases. Instead, we may update the corresponding feature version’s documents.

*Notification:* Maintenance releases are announced on our documentation website in a subsection of the Release Notes.
TigerGraph’s Customer Success team will proactively share the release notes with existing customers.

*Upgrade Support:* Users should refer to the xref:installation:upgrade.adoc[Upgrade] section of the documentation. Depending on the urgency of the patch, our Customer Success team may reach out to customers to discuss upgrading.

=== Patches

A patch is a limited scope update to a portion of the full product, to quickly address security vulnerabilities or critical functional issues.
Patches are released as the situation demands.
They could be universal, applicable to all users, or case-specific, applicable to systems deployed in a certain environment or configuration.

*Notification:* As a patch is being developed, the Customer Success team will reach out to the affected customers to inform them of the discovered issue and the immediate remediation plan while the patch is under development.

*Application of the patch:* After the patch is developed and has gone through the release certification process, the technical support team will email customers instructions on downloading and applying the patch.

*Post-release:* The patch will be merged in to future maintenance and feature releases. Given the additional time before those releases, the patch may be replaced with an improved solution to the problem.

=== Support

Customers who need assistance can open a support ticket at https://tigergraph.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/[TigerGraph's ZenDesk Portal].

== Managed Cloud Service

For customers who subscribe to TigerGraph’s Managed Cloud Service, our Cloud Engineering team will apply upgrades for backward compatible changes or One-Off patches transparently when the release is available or during the customer-notified system maintenance window (in situations requiring system downtime).

For releases with non-backward compatible changes, the TigerGraph Customer Success team will reach out to customers to discuss opt-out or opt-in choices.

Should the customer choose to opt-in, our Cloud Engineering team will coordinate and perform the upgrade for the customer.
