== TigerGraph 4.2 Compatibility Changes

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Version | Description | Recommendation

| 4.2.0
| xref:security:gsql-file-input-policy.adoc[File Input] and xref:security:file-output-policy.adoc[File Output] Policy changes require restarting `gsql` and `restpp` servers.
| Restart `gsql` and `restpp` with `gadmin restart gsql restpp -y` after policy updates.

| 4.2.0
| The `--incremental` backup option now performs true incremental backups.
| Plan xref:backup-and-restore:incremental-backup.adoc[backup and restore] processes accordingly.

| 4.2.0
| In CDC messages, the format of *tuple values* has changed.
| Update your applications that consume xref:system-management:change-data-capture/cdc-message-example.adoc#_message_examples[CDC messages] to handle the new format for tuple values.

| 4.2.0
| `SelectVertex()` no longer allows relative filepaths.
| Use absolute filepaths in `SelectVertex()` calls.

| 4.2.0
| The `--meta` option for backup is no longer needed because metadata is included automatically.
| Remove the `--meta` option from your `gadmin` backup commands

| 4.2.0
| External Kafka streaming connector (3.6 to 3.9.2) is no longer supported.
| Switch to supported Kafka connectors or newer versions.
