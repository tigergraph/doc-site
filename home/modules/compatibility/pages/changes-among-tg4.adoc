== TigerGraph 4.2 Compatibility Changes

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Version | Description | Recommendation

| 4.2.1
| Long and dynamic length BitwiseAccum (>64 bits or variable length) not supported in distributed mode and limited to 10,000,000 bits.
| Use single-node mode for long or dynamic BitwiseAccum and apply `.clear()` to manage memory. See xref:4.2@gsql-ref:querying:accumulators.adoc#_bitwiseandaccum_bitwiseoraccum[Bitwise Accumulators].

| 4.2.0
| xref:security:gsql-file-input-policy.adoc[File Input] and xref:security:file-output-policy.adoc[File Output] Policy changes require restarting `gsql` and `restpp` servers.
| Restart `gsql` and `restpp` with `gadmin restart gsql restpp -y` after policy updates.

| 4.2.0
| The `--incremental` backup option now performs true incremental backups.
| Plan xref:backup-and-restore:incremental-backup.adoc[backup and restore] processes accordingly.

| 4.2.0
| In CDC messages, the format of *tuple values* has changed.
| Update your applications that consume xref:system-management:change-data-capture/cdc-message-example.adoc#_message_examples[CDC messages] to handle the new format for tuple values.

| 4.2.0
| `SelectVertex()` no longer allows relative filepaths.
| Use absolute filepaths in `SelectVertex()` calls.

| 4.2.0
| The `--meta` option for backup is no longer needed because metadata is included automatically.
| Remove the `--meta` option from your `gadmin` backup commands

| 4.2.0
| External Kafka streaming connector (3.6 to 3.9.2) is no longer supported.
| Switch to supported Kafka connectors or newer versions.

| 4.2.0
| The format for tuple structures in CDC messages will change in a future version, likely similar to the new map format.
| Prepare CDC processing to adapt to future xref:{page-component-version}@tigergraph-server:system-management:change-data-capture/cdc-message-example.adoc#_cdc_message_with_type_edge[format changes].

== TigerGraph 4.1 Compatibility Changes

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Version | Description | Recommendation

| 4.1.0
| Many REST API endpoints were updated, including consolidation, path prefix changes, and token authentication support.
| Review and update API calls to match the new endpoints and authentication. See the xref:4.1@tigergraph-server:API:index.adoc[REST API reference].

| 4.1.0
| A full export package now includes access policies and template queries.
| Verify that exports include the new components when migrating or restoring data.

| 4.1.0
| Access Control Lists (ACLs) are no longer supported. ACL privileges are automatically migrated to object-based privileges during upgrade.
| Verify migrated privileges after upgrading from 3.x to 4.x. See xref:{page-component-version}@user-access:query-privilege-migration.adoc[Query privilege migration].

| 4.1.0
| Vertex-level Access Control (VLAC) and VLAC methods are removed.
| Remove any references to VLAC features in queries or applications.

| 4.1.0
| The `WRITE_DATA` RBAC privilege is deprecated.
| Replace usage of `WRITE_DATA` with the appropriate object-based privileges.
